# TODO: Implement Hero Section Slideshow

## Steps to Complete:

- [x] Step 1: Update `index.html` to replace the single hero image with a slideshow container containing both images (Herinspirer Logo first, LightHer flyer second).
- [x] Step 2: Update `style.css` to add slideshow styles, including transitions, and ensure mobile responsiveness (adjust height, font sizes, etc.).
- [x] Step 3: Update `script.js` to add JavaScript for slideshow functionality (auto-slide every 3-5 seconds, loop between the two images).
- [ ] Step 4: Test the slideshow by running the website locally and checking responsiveness on mobile devices.
